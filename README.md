# React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind

## To run the following project fo the following

- In the root folder in the terminal: npm i
- Then once the dependencies have installed: npm run dev
- Internet connection may be required for login with google

## Features implemented

- All shown in figma with interactive modal, variable options and context on hover
- Tradeoffs included not using an animation library for a nicer UI like framer motion and having much of the data be for show only, lacking more interactivity then the real application would have
- Limitations include time, as more time spread out allows better component building, only dummy data, unsure routing requriements or the full way in which the app works in practice etc
- Chose redux for global state, firebase for login as requested, TS, Tailwind, React Vite, Recharts for graphing
- Time spent, roughly 4 hours
